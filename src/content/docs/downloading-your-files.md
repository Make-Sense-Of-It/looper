title: Downloading your files
---

Once the files have been processed the ‘Download files’ becomes clickable. You can download the zip file using whatever name you choose.

Results are streamed from the API so each file is requested, processed and returned one-by-one. This means that if your connection to the API goes down you’ll still be able to save all the files that have already been processed and you won’t use up tokens for items that haven’t yet been processed.
