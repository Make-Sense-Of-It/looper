title: Starting a project

When you start a new project it is worth iterating your interactions with Looper and the large language model. That is, start with a single file and prompt to see that the response you receive matches your expectation. If it isn’t you have the chance to modify each of them. Once a single file is getting the expected response increase to three or five. Once you’re confident with that it’s likely OK to process all the files.
