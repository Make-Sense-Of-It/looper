If you’re already using lots of generative AI tools then Looper really isn’t very different. You will need:

* An account with either Anthropic or OpenAI  
* An API key that you’ve generated from them  
* Files that you want a large language model to loop over

You’ll then be able to add your key, upload your files and process them. Once the files have been processed you can click the “Download files” button.
