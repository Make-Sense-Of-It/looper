title: Token and API limits
---

For the web version of Looper there is a 3000 token limit for each file. This is to reduce the chance of hitting Vercelâ€™s API limits with multiple people using the tool. You can remove these limits if you clone or fork the project on [Github](https://github.com/hminnovation/looper).
